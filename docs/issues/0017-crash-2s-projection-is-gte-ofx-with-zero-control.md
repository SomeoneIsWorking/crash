title: "Crash 2's projection is GTE OFX with zero control-register readers, so the widening is Crash 1's — but its H is the near plane AND a HUD rectangle scalar"
status: open
symptom: "S006 recorded 'Crash 2 and Crash 3 own no projection owner at all' because guestWidescreenProjection() returned nullptr, and the disc was believed missing. It is not: scratch/bin/crash2/SCUS_941.54 is provisioned and identity-verified."

## The gap, and that it was a media problem wearing a capability problem's clothes

`BoundaryRuntime` inherits `GameRuntime::guestWidescreenProjection()`, which returns `nullptr`. That
was recorded as "no owner", which is an absence and not a measurement, and the recorded reason was
missing media. `tools/provision_title.py` produced `scratch/bin/crash2/SCUS_941.54` (327,680 bytes,
sha256 `6e5b2449…`, matching `titles/crash2/executable.json`), so every claim below is read from
bytes.

## What Crash 2's projection is, with the instruction words

A whole-image census of all **81,408** instruction words finds 1,024 opcode-0x12 (COP2) words — 320
`mfc2` data reads, 17 `cfc2` control reads, 332 `mtc2` data writes, 198 `ctc2` control writes, and 157
GTE commands. Exactly **two** control writers each for the three projection registers:

| register | writers | readers |
|---|---|---|
| CR[24] OFX | 0x8004EC9C, 0x8004EFF0 | **0** |
| CR[25] OFY | 0x8004ECA0, 0x8004EFF4 | **0** |
| CR[26] H | 0x8004EC7C, 0x8004F008 | 2 — 0x8004457C, 0x800447C4 |

The three publication entries, and the words that fix their semantics:

```
0x8004EC78  240803E8  addiu $t0,$zero,1000     }  projection init 0x8004EC30, called once from
0x8004EC7C  48C8D000  ctc2   $t0,0xD000       }  0x80015640 (word 0x0C013B0C). Also publishes
0x8004EC9C  48C0C000  ctc2   $zero,0xC000     }  ZSF3=0x155, ZSF4=0x100, DQA=0xEF9E, DQB=0x01400000
0x8004ECA0  48C0C800  ctc2   $zero,0xC800     }

0x8004EFE8  00042400  sll    $a0,$a0,16       }  set_geom_offset 0x8004EFE8, two call sites:
0x8004EFF0  48C4C000  ctc2   $a0,0xC000       }  0x800179CC and 0x80017F70, both word 0x0C013BFA
0x8004EFF4  48C5C800  ctc2   $a1,0xC800       }

0x8004F008  48C4D000  ctc2   $a0,0xD000       }  set_geom_screen 0x8004F008, four call sites:
                                                 0x80016EC4, 0x800179C0, 0x80020890, 0x8002F8B4,
                                                 all word 0x0C013C02
```

So the retail 4:3 projection is **OFX = 0, OFY = 0, and a per-camera-mode H**, with H = 1000 at boot
from `gte_init` and 288 from the camera setup `FUN_8001798c` at 0x800179C0. A resident-word scan finds
**zero** pointer-table entries equal to any of the three entries, so every call site is a `jal` and
`$r31 - 4` identifies it exactly — which is what lets the owner refuse an unmeasured call site instead
of guessing one.

## The hazard: H is the near plane, and H is also a HUD scalar

H is kept in the main-RAM global **`0x80060884`**, loader-created and outside the executable's own text
(`SCUS_941.54` is `0x800` header + `0x4F800` text and nothing else). Census, three instruments, each
with its own denominator and its own null (`tools/probe_title_projection.py`):

| instrument | reached | what it cannot reach |
|---|---|---|
| A — `lui 0x8006` + 16-bit displacement, 8-instruction lookback | 5 loads | a register proved further back, or a pointer |
| B — zero-displacement access whose register a `lui`+`addiu` pair proves | 4 sites (2 load, 2 store) | a pointer-form access |
| C — the manifest's named sites, verified as instruction words | 11 total (4 writers, 7 readers) | nothing it names |

**9 of the 11** are reached by A+B. The 2 that are not, `0x800179C4` and `0x80020310`, are pointer-form
writes. Instrument B's window was **wrong once**: at 6 instructions it missed `0x80016EC0`, because the
`addiu` sits 4 instructions above and the proving `lui` 5 above — a distance of 7. A truncated window
reported this title as having one writer instead of four. That is the class of wrong confident answer
this issue exists to warn about, and the value is now derived from the measured sites.

Two of the seven readers turn H into a **gameplay-visible** decision:

- **`FUN_8003d3cc` [0x8003D3CC,0x8003DA18)** rejects a vertex when `NOT (H < Z < 12000)`, where Z is
  the depth its own `rtps` produced. The far limit is the word `0x24012EE0` at 0x8003D4D4. **H is the
  GTE near plane**, exactly as in Crash 1, and the bound arrives as its 6th argument from
  `FUN_8001bd84` at 0x8001BDD0.
- **`FUN_8001645c` [0x8001645C,0x80016A68)** computes
  `(H * fog * 0xAA >> 20) - 0x6C` and uses it as a 2D overlay rectangle's Y and height, clamped to
  0..216 (`if (unaff_s2 < 0 || 0xd6 < unaff_s2)`). So H is a **HUD scalar**, not only a depth bound.

The other five are render-only: two `H/2` GTE light-intensity terms (`FUN_8001856c` at 0x80018614,
`FUN_800186d8` at 0x80018900), the writer's own change-detection compare at 0x80016EB8, a plain re-send
in `FUN_8002f6c8`, and two copies into the MVMVA translation vector's Z (CR[7]) at 0x8004457C and
0x800447C4 — the second reached as entry **0x800447DC** of the GTE command table at 0x8005B698, which
no call-target scan can see. Neither `cfc2` reaches a branch: both feed `ctc2 $t7,$7` immediately.

## The literal cull scan and its null

Over all 81,408 words, 13 immediate matches against a 4:3 dot width or a PSX visibility/pad mask, of
which the 4:3-width ones are `ori $4,0x0120` / `ori $2,0x0120` / `ori $5,0x0160` / `ori $2,0x0180` /
`ori $3,0x0180` / `ori $2,0x0180` / `addiu $2,$29,368` / `addiu $3,$3,-384` — bitmasks and stack
arithmetic, not compares. **NULL, stated: a cull against a variable bound carries no immediate and is
invisible to this scan.** It does not claim this image has no variable-bound cull; the census above is
what looks for those, and it found no screen-space cull among the eleven.

The draw area is the PSX default whole-display area — `lui $v1,0xE100` at 0x8004EB44 and
`sw $v0,0($a1)` at 0x8004EB64 store `(GPUSTAT & 0x3FFF) | 0xE1001000` — so this title has no second,
narrower clip rectangle for a widening to move.

## What was built

`titles/crash2/core/crash2_widescreen.*` over the shared rule in
`game/core/guest_projection_publication.*`. `Crash2Runtime::guestWidescreenProjection()` now returns the
owner instead of `nullptr`.

The widening moves **OFX** and holds **OFY** and **H**. It is safe here for one measured reason and not
for the one Crash 1 had to argue: **zero `cfc2` control reads of CR[24] and CR[25] anywhere in the
image**, and both call sites compute their centre from a guest global or a constant
(`FUN_80017bc4` at 0x80017F70 passes `_DAT_8006CC20 + 0x100`, and `DAT_8006CC20` is live). So the value
arriving at the leaf can never already carry the margin, and `retail + margin` is idempotent by
construction rather than by a guard.

## Verification

- The Ghidra programs were checked against the authenticated images before any decompilation was
  relied on: **81,408 of 81,408 words served and compared, zero mismatches, zero not fetched** (the
  9,790 words with no CodeUnit were read through `memory.getByte`, and the tool says so).
- 29/29 `ctest` green, including the 25 that existed before this change.
- `crash2_widescreen` pins 4:3 identity exactly at a non-zero retail centre, the 16:9 margin, the
  ride on a live centre, unwidening, both measured call sites widening, H untouched, the guest RAM
  bound, and an install proof with no HLE plan in existence.
- `crash2_projection_selftest` fires 10 cases, including a positive one for the truncated-window bug
  and a positive one for the pointer-form miss.
- `tools/probe_title_projection.py --title crash2 --executable scratch/bin/crash2/SCUS_941.54` diffs
  the constants this repository compiles against the manifest it just measured, so the two cannot
  drift.

## What this does not establish

No live leg. `BoundaryRuntime::registerOverrides` is `final` and Crash 2 still refuses to boot, so the
three measured overrides are **installed by the test and not by the product**, and the owner's runtime
hookup is the second half of a seam the boot work has to open. Nothing here shows a wide frame on
screen. The `H/2` light terms and the two translation-vector copies were read from the decompilation
and their instruction words verified; the other four readers of the bound were **not** decompiled, and
the eleven-site census is the honest denominator for what is known about them.
