title: Crash 1 product needs representative gameplay through Lightrec
status: investigating
symptom: The disc-backed product runs 400 frames and presents a picture, but the level's camera path never runs and no representative gameplay is reached

## Root cause

The static dispatcher and its corpus are gone. The native frame driver treated one finite Lightrec
execution budget as a complete display field, so a real run exited `BudgetExhausted` at `0x80013ADC`
inside the authenticated decompressor; it now resumes the exact returned guest PC across
positive-progress slices while preserving its CNT2 clock, and zero-progress exits are typed faults.

## Required resolution

Reach representative interactive gameplay on the authenticated `SCUS_949.00` image through psxport's
per-`Core` Lightrec executor, with Crash's native owners dispatching by complete image identity and
guest address, original calls bypassing only the current override, and every frame/host-work/interrupt
suspension an explicit executor exit. The product link audit continues to prove the gameplay binary
contains no explicit interpreter mode and no generated corpus.

Still open: the camera path does not run in a live unpaused level (issue 0024), so no gameplay state
is reached. After that, independent state/device comparison, override/original-call coverage,
executable-memory invalidation, and released-host qualification. The deleted static machinery must
not return.

Image admission is closed: `crash1_executable.*` checks the manifest size and SHA-256 on the same
bounded buffer it hands to `loadPsxExeImage`, and `tests/crash1_executable.cpp` drives the altered
digest, altered byte, short file and positive publication cases.
