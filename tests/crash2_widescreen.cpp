// Every case pins a PRODUCTION contract of `crash2::Crash2Widescreen`, and each is written so the
// mutation it claims to catch makes it fail. Nothing here reimplements the widening: the latch is the
// framework's own `gpu_vk_latch_guest_projection`, so a change to the framework's rule moves these
// expectations with it instead of letting a title's copy of the arithmetic rot.
//
// The measured inputs were read out of the authenticated executable and recorded in
// titles/crash2/executable.json:
//   0x8004EFF0  ctc2 $a0,0xC000   OFX = $a0 << 16   }  set_geom_offset 0x8004EFE8, whose body is
//   0x8004EFF4  ctc2 $a1,0xC800   OFY = $a1 << 16   }  byte-identical to Crash 3's 0x8004F704
//   0x8004F008  ctc2 $a0,0xD000   H   = $a0          }  set_geom_screen 0x8004F008

//   0x8004EC9C  ctc2 $zero,0xC000 OFX = 0            }  publishes the retail baseline from $zero
// and 320 is the display extent this owner measures from the guest's own GP1(0xC0) publication
// (the guest draw area is `(GPUSTAT & 0x3FFF) | 0xE1001000`, i.e. the whole display area), not a
